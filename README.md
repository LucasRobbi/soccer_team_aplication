# soccer_team_application Venturus

This soccer team application was made for testing my knowledge with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, programming logic and see how I do my own organization and documentation.

--Step by Step to use my application:

After download your .zip file from GitHub.

You can use XAMPP to create a localhost (or another similar program with similar function).

Install/Import the database (with phpAdmin in case you use XAMPP) that is located on assets/data/soccer_team_app.sql. (Data come from: "https://www.footballdatabase.eu/en/players", i have charged the top 10 for each position Goalkeeper, Full Back, Central Defender, Central Midfielder, Offensive Midfielder and Forward)

Alocate all content of zipfile on specifc archive (e.g.: C:\xampp\htdocs\soccer_team_aplication).

With your browser access localhost, and then you can start using the application.


(Players for team are alocated on database, so you will have a limited numbers of players to make tests).

--For tests: (All funciontions are working, except for share action and players are not charged on field when edit a team [the team members are saved, but they ont load on field]).

After start the application with start button, you will be redirected for My Teams Page, there you can see all teams created, you can: create a new team, edit or delete one that already exist.

-On Create a team:
You must place a Name, a Website and check which type the team will be. Others fields are not mandatory.
After complete all fields that you want to create, you can save then with Save Button that is alocated below field with players.

-On Edit team:
All data are saved, except for players are not uploaded on field (data still saved).
After complete all fields that you want to edit, you can save then with Save Button that is alocated below field with players.

-On Delete a team:
You jsut need to click on button. (should put a confirmation).

Enjoy the program
